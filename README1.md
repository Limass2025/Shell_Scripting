# Adding Comments in Bash Scripts
Comments are essential in programming, serving as notes to the programmer and anyone else who might read the code. They explain what the script or parts of the script do, making the code easier to understand and maintain. This section will guide you on how to add comments in

## What Are Comments?
Comments are lines in your code that are ignored by the interpreter. In Bash scripts, comments help document the purpose and logic of your code, making it easier for others (and yourself) to follow and understand the script's functionality. Single-Line Comments

## Key Features Demonstrated:

Script Header Comments - Proper documentation at the top including purpose, author, date, and version

Single-Line Comments - Using # for explanatory notes throughout the script

Inline Comments - Comments following commands on the same line

Multi-Line Comments - Using multiple # symbols to create detailed explanations

Function Documentation - Commenting functions to explain their purpose and logic

## Best Practices Examples:

Comments explain the "why" behind complex logic
Clear and concise explanations
Avoid over-commenting obvious code
Document business rules and complex operations

✅ **Shebang line** (`#!/bin/bash`)
✅ **Multi-line comments** at the top
✅ **Single-line comments** throughout
✅ **Functional commands**:
   - Creating a directory (`mkdir`)
   - Listing files (`ls`)
   - Printing messages (`echo`)
   - File operations (`cat`, `cd`)
✅ **Inline comments** explaining each step

The script is functional and will actually work when executed. You can copy this code, save it as `commented_script.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x commented_script.sh`, and run it with `./commented_script.sh`.
