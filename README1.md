# Adding Comments in Bash Scripts
Comments are essential in programming, serving as notes to the programmer and anyone else who might read the code.
They explain what the script or parts of the script do, making the code easier to understand and maintain. This section will guide you on how to add comments in 

## What Are Comments?
Comments are lines in your code that are ignored by the interpreter. In Bash scripts, comments help document the purpose and logic of your code, making it easier for others (and yourself) to follow and understand the script's functionality. Single-Line Comments

**Key Features Demonstrated:**

1. **Script Header Comments** - Proper documentation at the top including purpose, author, date, and version

2. **Single-Line Comments** - Using `#` for explanatory notes throughout the script

3. **Inline Comments** - Comments following commands on the same line

4. **Multi-Line Comments** - Using multiple `#` symbols to create detailed explanations

5. **Function Documentation** - Commenting functions to explain their purpose and logic

6. **Best Practices Examples:**
   - Comments explain the "why" behind complex logic
   - Clear and concise explanations
   - Avoid over-commenting obvious code
   - Document business rules and complex operations

**To run this exercise:**

1. Save the script as `commenting_exercise.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x commenting_exercise.sh`
3. Run it: `./commenting_exercise.sh`

The script includes practical examples like system information display, file operations, error handling, and conditional logic - all properly commented according to the best practices you've learned. This gives you hands-on experience with both Bash scripting fundamentals and professional commenting standards.
