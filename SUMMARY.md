SUMMARY
Based on this mini-project focused on working with functions in shell scripting, 
I learned several key concepts about organizing and structuring shell scripts for better maintainability and readability. Functions serve as essential building blocks that encapsulate specific logic, making code more modular and reusable. 
The project demonstrated how to create functions using proper syntax with descriptive names, and showed three practical examples: checking script arguments, verifying AWS CLI installation, and validating AWS profile environment variables. 
Key takeaways include the importance of function placement and calling order in scripts, the use of conditional statements with logical operators like `!` for negation and `-z` for testing empty strings, and how to handle error conditions with appropriate return codes. The refactored code structure with functions called at the end creates a clean, readable flow that clearly separates concerns and makes the script easier to understand and maintain. 
This approach is particularly valuable when developing infrastructure automation scripts for cloud environments like AWS, where multiple validation steps and environment-specific configurations are common requirements.
