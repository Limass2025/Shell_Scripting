SUMMARY
Code Implementation Features:

Function Structure: Each function has a clear purpose with descriptive names (check_num_of_args, activate_infra_environment, check_aws_cli, check_aws_profile)
Argument Validation: Proper checking for the correct number of arguments using "$#" -ne 1
Environment Logic: Conditional statements to handle different environments (local, testing, production)
AWS CLI Verification: Uses command -v aws with logical negation (!) to check installation
Profile Validation: Tests for empty AWS_PROFILE variable using the -z flag
Error Handling: Appropriate exit codes and return values for different error conditions
Clean Structure: Functions defined first, then called in logical order at the end
Output Feedback: Informative messages for each validation step

This implementation showcases the practical application of functions in shell scripting for AWS infrastructure automation, demonstrating improved code organization, reusability, and maintainability as discussed in the summary.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 

```
#!/bin/bash

# Environment variables
ENVIRONMENT=$1

# Function to check if script has correct number of arguments
check_num_of_args() {
    # Checking the number of arguments
    if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
        echo "Usage: $0 <environment>"
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Function to activate infrastructure environment
activate_infra_environment() {
    # Acting based on the argument value
    if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "local" ]; then
        echo "Running script for Local Environment..."
    elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "testing" ]; then
        echo "Running script for Testing Environment..."
    elif [ "$ENVIRONMENT" == "production" ]; then
        echo "Running script for Production Environment..."
    else
        echo "Invalid environment specified. Please use 'local', 'testing', or 'production'."
        exit 2
    fi
}

# Function to check if AWS CLI is installed
check_aws_cli() {
    if ! command -v aws &> /dev/null; then
        echo "AWS CLI is not installed. Please install it before proceeding."
        return 1
    fi
    echo "AWS CLI is installed and available."
}

# Function to check if AWS profile is set
check_aws_profile() {
    if [ -z "$AWS_PROFILE" ]; then
        echo "AWS profile environment variable is not set."
        echo "Using default profile or credentials from ~/.aws/credentials"
        return 0
    fi
    echo "AWS profile is set to: $AWS_PROFILE"
}

# Main execution - calling functions in order
check_num_of_args "$@"
activate_infra_environment
check_aws_cli
check_aws_profile

echo "All prerequisite checks completed successfully!"
echo "Ready to proceed with EC2 instances and S3 buckets setup for $ENVIRONMENT environment."

Based on this mini-project focused on working with functions in shell scripting, 
I learned several key concepts about organizing and structuring shell scripts for better maintainability and readability. Functions serve as essential building blocks that encapsulate specific logic, making code more modular and reusable. 
The project demonstrated how to create functions using proper syntax with descriptive names, and showed three practical examples: checking script arguments, verifying AWS CLI installation, and validating AWS profile environment variables. 
Key takeaways include the importance of function placement and calling order in scripts, the use of conditional statements with logical operators like `!` for negation and `-z` for testing empty strings, and how to handle error conditions with appropriate return codes. The refactored code structure with functions called at the end creates a clean, readable flow that clearly separates concerns and makes the script easier to understand and maintain. 
This approach is particularly valuable when developing infrastructure automation scripts for cloud environments like AWS, where multiple validation steps and environment-specific configurations are common requirements.
