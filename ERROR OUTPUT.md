ERROR OUTPUT

Based on this output, I've gained valuable insights into AWS automation and error handling in bash scripting. The project demonstrated the importance of implementing robust error handling mechanisms when working with cloud resources, particularly when scripts might be executed multiple times. 

The key learning was that AWS resources like S3 buckets have unique naming requirements and attempting to recreate existing resources will cause failures. By implementing pre-checks using commands like `aws s3api head-bucket`, we can gracefully handle scenarios where resources already exist, preventing script failures and unnecessary resource creation attempts. This approach of checking resource state before creation is a fundamental best practice in infrastructure automation, ensuring scripts are idempotent and can be safely re-run without causing errors. The project also highlighted the importance of proper error handling with conditional statements and exit code checking (`$?`) to provide meaningful feedback to users about the success or failure of operations. This defensive programming approach is essential when building reliable automation scripts for cloud infrastructure management.
